\section{Derivatives and Differential Equations}

A \textit{differential equation}\index{differential equation} is
simply an equation involving functions and their derivatives. Here is an example:
\[
2\cdot \frac{d^2f}{dx^2} + 3\cdot \frac{df}{dx} + 3\cdot f = g.
\]

You might in words say that ``A function $f$ satisfies the differential equation if twice its second-derivative plus three times its first derivative plus three times itself equals another function $g$''

\begin{question}
  What is a differential equation?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{An equation that you take the derivative of.}
    \choice[correct]{An equation that relates the rates of a function to other values.}
    \choice{It is a formula for the slope of a tangent line at a given point.} 
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}

When we solve differential equations, we find
\textit{functions} satisfying the equation.
\begin{question}
  Which of the following functions solve the differential equation
  \[
  \frac{d^4f}{dx^4} = f?
  \]

  \begin{hint}
    Remember, $\frac{d^4f}{dx^4}$ is the fourth derivative of $f$.
  \end{hint}

  \begin{selectAll}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = \sin(x)$}
    \choice{$f(x) = x^2$}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = e^x$}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = e^{-x}$}
    \choice{$f(x) = \tan(x)$}
  \end{selectAll}
  \begin{feedback}
    ANY function that is the same as its 4th derivative satisfies the equation. 
    In fact, we can combine all possible allowed functions from the list above to make a very general solution: $c_1\sin(x)+c_2\cos(x)+c_3e^x+c_4e^{-x}$.  
    
    In other words, every
    solution to this differential equation can be written in this form.
    You should check that these are all solutions (for example $f(x) =
    \sin(x)+3\cos(x)-7e^x+\pi e^{-x}$ is a solution). 
  \end{feedback}
\end{question}

We get more specific solutions to differential equations when we add \emph{boundary conditions}. That is, we specify the values at which the solution function starts and stops and then solve for the function values in between the boundary points. 

Let's specify some boundary conditions 

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        domain=-pi:pi,
        samples=200,
        axis lines=middle,
        xlabel={$x$},
        ylabel={$y$},
        xtick={-3.1416, -1.5708, 1.5708, 3.1416},
        xticklabels={$-\pi$, $-\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\pi$},
        ytick={-2, -1, 0, 1, 2},
        %grid=major,
        xmin=-pi, xmax=pi,
        ymin=-2, ymax=2,
        xmajorgrids=false % Disable grid lines for x-axis
    ]
    % Plot various functions restricted to -pi/2 to pi/2
    \addplot[blue, thick, domain=-pi/2:pi/2] {cos(deg(x))^2};

    \addplot[red, thick, domain=-pi/2:pi/2] {sin(deg(x))^2 - 1};

    \addplot[green, thick, domain=-pi/2:pi/2] {exp(-abs(x)) * cos(deg(x))};

    \addplot[purple, thick, domain=-pi/2:pi/2] {-exp(-abs(x)) * cos(deg(x))};

    \addplot[orange, thick, domain=-pi/2:pi/2] {0.5 * cos(deg(x))};

    % Add arrows pointing to -pi/2 and pi/2
    %\node[above left, black] at (2, 1) {Boundary Conditions};
    %\draw[->, black, thick] (2,.8) -- (-1.5708, 0);

    %\node[above right, black] at (2,1) {Boundary Conditions};
    %\draw[->, black, thick] (2,.8) -- (1.5708, 0);

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

Here, the boundary conditions are that $f=0$ at $x=\frac{-\pi}{2}$ and $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$. We call the points $x=\frac{-\pi}{2}$ and $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$ the \emph{boundary points} since they are at the edge of the interval $[\frac{-\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$, every other $x$-values in on the interior of the interval.

As you can see, there are many functions that satisfy these boundary conditions. In fact, all functions in the figure above, (but also an infinite amount of different functions) satisfy the boundary conditions. Fewer functions satisfy both the boundary conditions and the differential equation $\frac{d^4f}{dx^4} = f$.

The unique group of functions satisfying both the boundary conditions and the differential equations are the functions $\ell\cos(x)$, constant multiples of the cosine function. This is because 

$$\frac{d^4}{dx^4}\left(\ell\cos(x)\right)=\ell\frac{d^4}{dx^4}\cos(x)=\ell\cos(x),$$

and $\cos(\pi/2)=0$ and $\cos(-\pi/2)=0$ (as do constant multiples).

\section{Approximating Derviatives}

As we'll see later, at times it's better (or necessary) to just approximate the derivative or function values rather than to work with abstractly stated differential equations and functions. We will be doing this later in reference to the heat equation and Poisson's equation. 

For our purposes, we want to approximate the derivative (and 2nd derivative as we'll see) using \emph{only values of f}. That we only use values of \emph{f} is important for our use of linear algebra, as this will let us set up and solve systems of equations to find our solutions.

For instance, if we break up $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ into 6 intervals, we get the following grid along the $x$-axis and the corresponding function values along the graph.

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        domain=-1.5708:1.5708, % Limits for -pi/2 to pi/2 in radians
        samples=200,
        axis lines=middle,
        xlabel={$x$},
        ylabel={$y$},
        xtick={-1.5708, -1.0472, -0.5236, 0, 0.5236, 1.0472, 1.5708},
        xticklabels={$-\frac{\pi}{2}$, $-\frac{\pi}{3}$, $-\frac{\pi}{6}$, $0$, $\frac{\pi}{6}$, $\frac{\pi}{3}$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$},
        ytick={-1, 0, 1},
        xmin=-1.8, xmax=1.8,
        ymin=-1.2, ymax=1.2,
        grid=none,
    ]
    % Plot the sine function
    \addplot[blue, thick] {sin(deg(x))};

    % Add grid points on the x-axis
    \foreach \x in {-1.5708, -1.0472, -0.5236, 0, 0.5236, 1.0472, 1.5708} {
        \addplot[only marks, mark=*, mark options={red}] coordinates {(\x, 0)};
    }

    % Add grid points on the sine function
    \foreach \x in {-1.5708, -1.0472, -0.5236, 0, 0.5236, 1.0472, 1.5708} {
        \addplot[only marks, mark=*, mark options={blue}] coordinates {(\x, {sin(deg(\x))})};
    }

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

If we wanted to approximate the derivative $\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x)$ around $\frac{\pi}{3}$, we could find the slope of the line connecting $\sin(\pi/6)$ and $\sin(\pi/2)$, as below.

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        domain=-1.5708:1.5708, % Limits for -pi/2 to pi/2 in radians
        samples=200,

        %xlabel={$x$},
        ylabel={$y$},
        xtick={-1.5708, -1.0472, -0.5236, 0, 0.5236, 1.0472, 1.5708},
        xticklabels={$-\frac{\pi}{2}$, $-\frac{\pi}{3}$, $-\frac{\pi}{6}$, $0$, $\frac{\pi}{6}$, $\frac{\pi}{3}$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$},
        ytick={-1, 0, 1},
        xmin=-1.8, xmax=1.8,
        ymin=-1.2, ymax=1.2,
        grid=none,
    ]
    % Plot the sine function
    \addplot[blue, thick] {sin(deg(x))};

    % Add grid points on the x-axis
    \foreach \x in {-1.5708, -1.0472, -0.5236, 0, 0.5236, 1.0472, 1.5708} {
        \addplot[only marks, mark=*, mark options={red}] coordinates {(\x, 0)};
    }

    % Add grid points on the sine function
    \foreach \x in {-1.5708, -1.0472, -0.5236, 0, 0.5236, 1.0472, 1.5708} {
        \addplot[only marks, mark=*, mark options={blue}] coordinates {(\x, {sin(deg(\x))})};
    }

    % Add labels for x_n, x_{n-1}, and x_{n+1}
    \node[above right] at (axis cs:1.0472, 0) {$x_6$};     % pi/3
    \node[above right] at (axis cs:0.5236, 0) {$x_{5}$}; % pi/6
    \node[above right] at (axis cs:1.5708, 0) {$x_{7}$}; % pi/2

    % Draw secant line between points on sine function from pi/6 to pi/2
    \addplot[red, dashed] coordinates {
        (0.5236, {sin(deg(0.5236))}) 
        (1.5708, {sin(deg(1.5708))})
    };
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

We might say $\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x)|_{\pi/3}\approx \frac{\sin(\pi/2)-\sin(\pi/6)}{\pi/2-\pi/6}\approx .447465$. Compared to the exact value of the derivative $\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x)|_{\pi/3}=\cos(\pi/3)=.5$, this isn't too bad in the grand scheme of things, and would improve dramatically if we reduce the interval over which the derivative was approximated (i.e. $[\pi/6,\pi/2]$ is somewhat of a large interval for an approximation).

Notice that $\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{3}, $ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$ were labeled $x_5, x_6$ and $x_7$. This is becuase we broke the interval into $6$ subintervals, with $7$ points. Using this approximation technique, we can approximate the value of $\frac{d}{dx}f$ at an point $x_n$ with what is called the ``centered difference''

$$\frac{f(x_{n+1})-f(x_{n-1})}{2\Delta x},$$ 

where $\Delta x$ is the space between the grid points, as depicted below.

\begin{tikzpicture}

    % Draw secant lines between adjacent points
    \foreach \xA/\xB in {-1.57/-0.52, -1.05/0, 0/1.05, -0.52/0.52, 0.52/1.57} {
        \addplot[red, dashed] coordinates {
            (\xA, {sin(deg(\xA))})
            (\xB, {sin(deg(\xB))})
        };
    }

        }

    \node[below] at (axis cs:0.785, -0.2) {$\Delta x$};

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

We can use Taylor Series (remember from Calc II?) to find a similar approximation of $\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$ to be 

$$\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}\approx \frac{f(x_{n+1})-2f(x_n)+f(x_{n-1})}{\left(\Delta x\right)^2}.$$


\section{Derivatives and Differential Equations in Multiple Variables}

As much as we love the simplicity of single-variable calculus, the world is not so simple. Luckily, some ideas generalize fairly intuitively, such as the idea of a function of two or more variables, and derivatives in the directions of the variables $x$ and $y$. 

While there is much more nuance to unpack here, a summary of the ideas are as follows:

A function $f$ of two input variables $x$ and $y$ can be thought of as the height of a surface above a 2D grid of points $(x,y)$, such as the function for the volume of a cylinder given in the GeoGebra applet below:

\begin{center}
    \geogebra{hydwshe2}{733}{520}
\end{center}

Taking derivatives of these functions in many cases amounts to picking a direction (such as $x$ or $y$) on the $(x,y)$ plane, tracing the graph of a 1D function along the surface, and taking its derivative in the usual sense. 

This process is depicted in the GeoGebra applet below, where you can pick the $x$ or $y$ directions to take a derivative, zoom in near where the derivative is being calculated, and then choose to hide or show the underlying surface. 

\begin{center}
    \geogebra{fftcpbzk}{741}{572}
\end{center}

For our purposes, we'll denote a derivative in the $x$ and $y$ directions with the usual notation: $\frac{df}{dx}$ and $\frac{df}{dy}$, but it is more standard to use the ``partial'' derivative notation $\partial$ instead of the derivative $d$.


\section{Approximating Solutions to the Heat Equation}

The Heat Equation is an example of a multi-variable differential equation (i.e. a ``partial differential equation'') that describes how heat is distributed within an object and how that heat changes over time. 

A very simple example is given below, where heat is distributed throughout a flat plate. 

%854.2x855.41
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=22.6cm, height=22.63cm]{heat_equation_plate.png}
\end{center}

On this plate, the left side (blue) is cold, the right side (red) is hot, and any black regions are evened out at $0^\circ$.

The boundary conditions are that the top and left sides of the plate remain hot, the bottom and left sides of the plate remain cool, and the differential equation is concerned with how the interior temperatures change under these conditions.

%854.2x577
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=22.6cm, height=15.27cm]{heat_boundary.png}
\end{center}

If the cold and hot parts of the plates are instantly fused together, and the only heat sources are the set boundary conditions, then the interior will reach what is called a ``steady state'' where changes to the heat distribution in the plate cease, and the temperatures persist as time progresses. 

A simulation of this steady-state process for this example is seen below:

\begin{center}
    \youtube{HQynIgu3a5A}
\end{center}

You might think of this steady-state heat phenomenon using the following general (but imprecise) heuristic: 

the heat at any one point on the plate is the average heat of its neighboring points. 

Under this heuristic, the solution makes sense as the hot and cold boundaries propogate heating (and cooling) inward but balance out in the middle as the hot and cold temperatures balance out. 

A more precise way to view this process is through the differential equation called Poisson's Equation (also in this case Laplace's Equation): 

$$\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}+\frac{d^2f}{dy^2}=0.$$

That is, the 2nd derivative in the $x$ and $y$ directions at any one point on the interior grid balance out.

If we break apart the plate into a grid of $(x,y)$ values, as below:

%854.2x848.08
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=22.6cm,height=22.44cm]{heat_grid.png}
\end{center}

Then the $(x,y)$ would give the location on the grid, and the function value $f$ would give the heat (positive for hot, or red and negative for cold, or blue).

The differential equation 

$$\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}+\frac{d^2f}{dy^2}=0$$

states that at any $(x,y)$, if we start at the location $(x,y)$, which has a heat value $f$, and take the 2nd derivative in the $x$ direction and add it to the 2nd derivative in the $y$ direction, they sum to zero, as depicted below:

%same as grid
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=22.6cm,height=22.44cm]{heat_grad.png}
\end{center}

\section{Simulating the Heat Equation Pt 1}

Solving this in its full generality requires some high-level mathematics, typically called  ``Boundary Value Problems'' or ``Partial Differential Equations'', but we can put all of our work so far together and use Linear Algebra to approximate a steady-state solution.

First, we break the grid into points $x_{i,j}$, as seen below:


\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=22.6cm, height=16.97cm]{heat_grid_breakdown.png}
\end{center}

We can break the grid down into rows and columns, which will come in handy later when we use matrices to simulate the change in state over time.

Then, we use our Taylor Series approximations of the 2nd derivative from earlier 

$$\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}\approx \frac{f(x_{n+1})-2f(x_n)+f(x_{n-1})}{\left(\Delta x\right)^2}$$

to approximate $\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$ and $\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$ so that we can state the heat equation approximately along our grid. 

First, note a few things, $\Delta w$ and $\Delta h$ (height and width) are the physical distances between grid points. So they depend on the size of the plate, and if we have a rectangular plate but an even grid, we would expect different values of $\Delta w$ and $\Delta h$. In this case, let's say we're working with an 26x24 inch plate, so 11 rows and 10 columns in the middle (plus a row and column on the boundary makes $\Delta w=2$ and $\Delta h=2$.

With this in mind, vertical difference means changing rows, so going from $x_{1,1}$ to $x_{2,1}$ is a vertical change of $\Delta h=2$. Similarly, horizontal changes move along columns, so $x_{1,1}\rightarrow x_{1,2}$ is a change of $\Delta w=2$.

We care about the temperature, $f$ at each location $x_{i,j}$, so using the Taylor approximation horizontally away from $x_{i,j}$ yields

$$\frac{d^2f}{dw^2}\approx \frac{f(x_{i,j+1})-2f(x_{i,j})+f(x_{i,j-1})}{\left(\Delta w\right)^2}$$

and the Taylor approximation vertically away from $x_{i,j}$ yields

$$\frac{d^2f}{dh^2}\approx \frac{f(x_{i+1,j})-2f(x_{i,j})+f(x_{i-1,j})}{\left(\Delta h\right)^2}.$$

Putting this together into Poisson's equation, we get

$$\frac{f(x_{i,j+1})-2f(x_{i,j})+f(x_{i,j-1})}{\left(\Delta w\right)^2}+\frac{f(x_{i+1,j})-2f(x_{i,j})+f(x_{i-1,j})}{\left(\Delta h\right)^2}=0.$$

Why all of this work? Well this has been all leading up to an ability to simulate the Heat Equation on this plate, which means we need to find a way to figure out what the heat values in a location $x_{i,j}$ are. If we can do this, we can use a computer to update the temperature values as time evolves, and we can also set up a system of equations to solve for what the steady state should be. 

With a little algebra, we can solve for $f(x_{i,j})$ to be

$$f(x_{i,j})=\frac{\left(\Delta h\right)^2(f(x_{i,j+1})+f(x_{i,j-1}))+\left(\Delta w\right)^2(f(x_{i+1,j})+f(x_{i-1,j}))}{2(\left(\Delta w\right)^2+\left(\Delta h\right)^2)},$$

and if we have unit spacing then this reduces to 

$$f(x_{i,j})=\frac{(f(x_{i,j+1})+f(x_{i,j-1}))+(f(x_{i+1,j})+f(x_{i-1,j}))}{4},$$

which is where the original loose heuristic of ``the heat at any location is the average of its neighbors'' comes from.

\section{Simulating the Heat Equation Pt 2}

We can use this information about $f(x_{i,j})$ in two ways, which you will do in your project:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Simulate the evolution of the heat on the plate as time goes on under the rules. 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        
        \item Use a matrix to represent the grid, use the top, bottom, left and right edges of the matrix (i.e. row 1, column 1, row N, column N) to be the boundary that has fixed values. 
        \item Use the rest of the matrix to take the heat values $f(x_{i,j})$ at location $x_{i,j}$ (aka row $i$, column $j$).
        \item Start with the initial heat values of the plate (i.e. the initial conditions) and use the approximate equation for $f(x_{i,j})$ to update the heat at each iteration.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Use each interior heat value $f(x_{i,j})$ as a variable, which makes each approximation of the Heat Equation a linear equation involving 5 variables.
    \item Set up a system of equations, one equation for each interior location on the grid.
    \item Solve the system of equations using matrix techniques.

\end{enumerate}

Again within the grid breakdown, we can update $f(x_{1,1})$ and $f(x_{2,2})$ as below. For simplicity, let's assume the top boundary is fixed at $10^\circ$ and the left boundary is fixed at $-10^\circ$, we'll also assume that, as in the initial conditions, the entire grid in this region was also initially cold at $-10^\circ$. Finally, let's start simply by saying that $\Delta w=\Delta h=1$

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=22.6cm, height=16.97cm]{heat_grid_breakdown.png}
\end{center}

So for $f(\textcolor{darkpurple}{x_{1,1}})$, we get

$$f(\textcolor{darkpurple}{x_{1,1}})=\frac{\left(\Delta h\right)^2(f(x_{1,2})+f(\textcolor{darkbluishgreen}{x_L}))+\left(\Delta w\right)^2(f(x_{2,1})+f(\textcolor{crimsonred}{x_T}))}{2(\left(\Delta w\right)^2+\left(\Delta h\right)^2)}=\frac{-10\textcolor{darkbluishgreen}{-10}-10\textcolor{crimsonred}{+10}}{4}=-5,$$

so after one iteration $f(\textcolor{darkpurple}{x_{1,1}})$ became half as cold. 

Similarly, we could run calculations to see that after one iteration, $f(\textcolor{burntorange}{x_{2,2}})$ would not change (all of its neighbors were initially $-10^\circ$), however after more iterations the heat from the top layer would permeate to $f(\textcolor{burntorange}{x_{2,2}})$

\section{Poisson's Equation and Electrostatics}

Next, we apply the same process to Poisson's Equation where we also have some internal sources of heat, or of charge in the case of electro statics. Rather than the simple equation 

$$\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}+\frac{d^2f}{dy^2}=0,$$

we add a function that tells us locations of a source within the plate itself, states As

$$\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}+\frac{d^2f}{dy^2}=S.$$

Imagine a heat source underneath the plate in specific locations, or electric charges located at the specified regions. 

The strategy for simulation and equation-solving doesn't change, we just have more information to incorporate into our update matrix and system of equations. $S$ will be given to you, and will essentially be a grid just like the simulation grid but will have fixed values at specified locations.
